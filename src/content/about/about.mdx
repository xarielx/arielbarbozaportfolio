Hey, I’m Ariel. I live in Melbourne, FL and I’m a Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin, an aerospace, arms, defense, information security, and technology company with worldwide interests.

I have a background and over 3 years experience as a Customer Service and Technical Support Representative. Some of the companies I worked for are Amazon.com, Hewlett-Packard and CareerBuilder.com

After deciding that I wanted to shift away from call centers, I joined the United States Army as a Tank Crewman, primarily stationed in Fort Bliss, Texas.

After honorably serving the U.S. Army, I successfully obtained a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science from the University of Florida. Go Gators!

I am currently a Master of Engineering candidate at Cornell University.

In my free time you can find me going to the gym, traveling, going to all theme parks, and surfing.
